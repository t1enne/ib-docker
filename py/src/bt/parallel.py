"""Small process-pool runner for parallel sweep / split / optimize.

Motivation: ``run_sweep``, ``run_split`` and ``run_optimize`` are naturally
parallel — sweep across grid combos, the IS/OOS window pair per fold. A
**process** pool (not a thread pool) is the right tool because backtests are
CPU-bound and the backtest engine is pure over immutable inputs, so there is
no shared-memory state to contend on.

How it works
------------
The backtest engine is functionally pure: given a ``StrategyConfig``, a sliced
candle feed and (for DSL strategies) freshly-minted per-run ``ctx.shared``
state, a run is fully deterministic. Process workers get that isolation for
free — each worker is its own interpreter, so nothing bleeds across units of
work (and separate workers never share the same candle feed cursor).

The one expensive thing to move across the process boundary is a pandas
DataFrame feed. To avoid re-pickling the same feed for every task, the pool
bootstraps each worker once with ``pool_init``: shared read-only inputs (the
feed(s), the base config) are stored in a per-worker ``WORKER_STATE`` dict.
Tasks then carry only small per-unit args and reference the cache by key.

``run_in_processes`` submits ``fn(task)`` per task, maps results back to input
order, and invokes ``on_complete(index, result)`` as soon as each task's
result is "unblocked" (all earlier tasks done) so callers can stream output in
a deterministic order even though work completes out of order. ``workers <= 1``
falls back to a plain sequential loop — preserving all existing behaviour and
programmatic/tests paths that never pass ``workers``.

Worker functions must be *module-level* (picklable by qualified name) and read
shared inputs from ``WORKER_STATE``.
